<h2> Create smooth masks for projection mapping</h2>

Zorro was created with openFrameworks on Windows with Visual Studio 2017. <br>
The only dependency is the great addon ofxDatGui from Stephen Braitsch (http://braitsch.io).

The best way to use it is to mirror your desktop onto the projector and make the Zorro window fill your screen, then use the menu to create and edit shapes. <br> When saving the mask, a png is created, that you can use in your media server or VJ software.

You can download a compiled version for Windows here: https://github.com/DFortmann/Zorro/raw/master/Zorro%20v2.zip
